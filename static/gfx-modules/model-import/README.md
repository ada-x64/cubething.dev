## About

This is a simple test module for my rendering engine [Sundile](https://github.com/ada-x64/sundile_rs).

There are about 100 cubes here, rotated at various angles and efficiently instantiated.

The simulation is running on WGPU (translated into WebGL2) in an iframe. Hopefully it works for you :)

I plan on doing a lot more of this.
